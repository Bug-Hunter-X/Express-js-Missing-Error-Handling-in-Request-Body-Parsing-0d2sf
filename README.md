# Express.js Missing Error Handling in POST Request

This repository demonstrates a common error in Express.js applications: insufficient error handling when parsing request bodies using `express.json()`.  The `bug.js` file shows an example of this vulnerability.  The `bugSolution.js` file provides a corrected version with robust error handling.

## The Problem

The original code lacks error handling for scenarios where the request body is missing, empty, or improperly formatted.  This can lead to application crashes or unexpected behavior, such as silent failures without informative error messages.

## The Solution

The solution involves validating the request body and implementing appropriate error handling using middleware or try-catch blocks.  This ensures that the application gracefully handles invalid requests, providing informative error messages to the client.
